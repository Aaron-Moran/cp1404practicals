# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I was often a little bit slower than what I would estimate. although, for the most part, i was usually within 10-15 minutes of what I would expect.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It honestly always varied a bit, although, I think I got mildly more acccurate as we went further into teh course.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

At first, it was that coding takes a bit longer than I would expect for me. On a more practical level, the estimates allowed me to guage how long a project would take for me and helped me gain the ability to estimate those times more accurately.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

most of the reviews of my code were rather barren, the best I got was about my commit messages, which I do agree, is probably one of the worst things I do.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

It was interesting seeing how vastly different every persons code can be, yet still achieve the same or similar result. I saw approaches to some practicals which i didnt think to take, which is really cool.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 5 Review](https://github.com/dipro1/cp1404practicals/pull/3#issue-3604478901)

### Explanation

I would say that the amount of things to talk about in the earlier reviews was higher due to people being less adept at everything. Also it was an interesting case of seeing how someone else decided to layout there code and helping them rearrange it to fit with the expected layout. 

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 7 Review](https://github.com/dipro1/cp1404practicals/pull/3#issue-3604478901)

### Explanation

I think i put the most work into this one, there were some errors in the code which i tried helping with. For the most part, again layout was interestingly messy and the main goal of the review was to show a better layout methodology to the author. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Overall, the practicals were verry well handled and not too overbearing. I think the only thing that could be changed is just making sure some of the guides for using the programs are as up to date as possible, but even then, they are navigable.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I would have to say layout. I tried hard to have clean and readable layout in all my code.
