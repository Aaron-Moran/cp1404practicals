# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have had to change my main study time to be on the week end for this subject to other commitments.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Currently, I am working to catch up with all my studies. falling ill really put me back a few steps, esspecially in Trimester. 
so Hopefully, i can get all my assessment underwraps and get back on top of everything.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think i am matching the style guide and PEP 8 rather well, which was a big goal for me.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to work on my commit messages. making them match the desired style better.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Maybe use VS code rather than pycharm. however, i understand that pycharm is specifically designed for python.
I was just thinking that people will use VS code quite a bit since it is used in many languages.
Using VS code would lead to student having more exposure to the tool and allow them to more quickly pick up other coding languages.
